Introduction
============

Quickly export the content of a Plone registry configuration (defined by an interface) in a Python
structure compatible with JSON format:

.. code-block:: python

    import json
    from collective.regjsonify.interfaces import IJSONifier
    from plone.registry.interfaces import IRegistry
    from zope.component import queryUtility
    
    registry = queryUtility(IRegistry)
    settings = registry.forInterface(IYouInterfaceSettings)
    python_data = IJSONifier(settings).json()
    json_data = json.dumps(python_data)

Extending
=========

The package came with a default set of know data types that cover common fields used in Plone registry.
However this set can be not complete if you are saving in the registry an unknown custom type.

During export operation unknown data are ignored.

If you want to export other types you must manually provide the proper ``IJSONFieldDumper`` adapter:

.. code-block:: xml

    <adapter
      factory="your.package.YouExportAdapter"
      provides="collective.regjsonify.interfaces.IJSONFieldDumper"
      for="your.package.interfaces.IYourFieldType"
      />
